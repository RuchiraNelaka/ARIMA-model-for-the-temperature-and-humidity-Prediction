# ARIMA-model-for-the-temperature-and-humidity-Prediction
Its all about predict the temperature up to 12 months ahead with using the ARIMA model for the temperature and humidity prediction..


This Project compromised with three Main Objectives
1. Sense the current ambient temperature.
2. Depending on the current temperature, move an indicator on a display gauge to indicate how
the temperature would feel.
3. Display a visualization of past data, data coming from the sensors on a Node-RED dashboard and
predict the temperature up to 12 months ahead with using the ARIMA model for the temperature and humidity prediction
